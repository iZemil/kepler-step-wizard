# TASK

Your job is to create a multi-step wizard.

1. It has multiple steps.
2. It has a current steps counter somewhere (e.g., 5/10 steps completed)
3. Each step is a questionnaire
4. Each question has only 1 type out of the following
    - Input box
    - Multi-choice question
    - Single-choice question
    - Numeric single input

You should implement such functionality in Angular. You can’t use any 3rd party plugins which already implement this solution.

You could safely assume that each step is configured on the “backend” through the JSON  config file. The actual structure of the file is up to you to decide.

If you have enough backend knowledge, please consider demonstrating it by adding simple ORM integration, message queues, caches, etc. if you think it’s necessary.

Don’t spend time on the “beauty” part of this task. It should be purely functional.

In general, don’t spend more than 8 hours on this task.

Please expect to enhance this solution in the following interview stage in a coding session (on your machine, through screen sharing).

Regarding the inspiration for the multi-step wizard functionality, you could use this reference https://www.typeform.com/templates/c/quizzes/ or any other one of your choice.
